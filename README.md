This repository contains a simple implementation of a decision tree algorithm (following Quinlan's ID3). To represent the data set, it uses the [Weka library](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).

This implementation has purely educational purposes and should (probably) not be used for productive use.
